## Overview & Core Concepts

### Overview

The EduAgent is an AI-powered learning platform that helps students study course materials through intelligent document processing, interactive chat, and AI-generated study aids. The system processes uploaded documents, extracts content using Azure Content Understanding, creates vector embeddings for semantic search, and generates quizzes and flashcards automatically.

### Project-Based Organization

All content is organized within **Projects**. A project represents a course or subject area and contains:

- Documents (course materials and notes)
- Chats (conversations with the AI tutor)
- Quizzes (AI-generated multiple-choice questions)
- Flashcard groups (AI-generated study cards)
- Notes (AI-generated study notes)
- Mind Maps (visual knowledge representations)
- Study Plans (personalized learning paths)
- Practice records (tracking of user progress)

Each project has a language code that determines the language used for AI-generated content.

### Document Processing Pipeline

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant API as API (edu-api)
    participant B as Azure Blob Storage
    participant Q as Azure Storage Queue
    participant W as Worker (edu-worker)
    participant CU as Content Understanding
    participant AO as Azure OpenAI / AI Foundry
    participant V as Vector Database (pgvector)

    U->>API: Upload Document
    API->>B: Store file blob
    API->>Q: Enqueue processing task
    W->>Q: Dequeue task
    W->>CU: Extract text & generate summary
    W->>AO: Generate embeddings for segments
    AO-->>W: Embedding vectors
    W->>V: Store segments & embeddings
```

Documents go through several processing stages:

1. **UPLOADED** - Initial upload to blob storage
2. **PROCESSING** - Text extraction in progress
3. **PROCESSED** - Text extracted and stored
4. **INDEXED** - Segments created and embeddings generated
5. **FAILED** - Processing encountered an error
